This hilarious campaign won a cannes lions international ad festival film price<br><br>
The spot opens with a red lamp, obviously from Ikea, in the corner of a room. Sad piano music pulls on the heartstrings as the lamp gets cast out on to the street. It’s slow, deliberate and agonizing, before flipping a switch. A peculiar Swedish man approaches the camera and says: “Many of you feel bad for this lamp. That is because you crazy . It has no feelings, and the new one is much better.”<br><br>

YEah IKEA tricks viewers into feeling sorry for furniture!!<br><br>

I was mind blown watching this TV commercial, These story-driven commercials don’t just sell a product; they sell an experience, an emotion. Brands like IKEA master the art of storytelling in their ads often find themselves etched in the collective memory of their audience, reaping benefits long after the commercial has aired.<br><br>

And as a video marketer, I have always been interested in employing the art of storytelling when it comes to creating content and video ads for brands, for me it's a strategic choice that boasts tangible benefits.</p>

							This professional campaign titled 'The Worst Song in the World' was published in France in April, 2018. It was created for the brand: Monoprix, by ad agency: Rosapark. This Film medium campaign is related to the Retail Services industry and contains 2 media assets. the video racked up 16 million views in 2 weeks.<br><br>

							When you are serious about attracting customers, what is something great you can do? Make ‘em laugh, and says " ohh they got me!!" <br><br>
							
							Humor video commercials a key element of the most successful marketing campaigns throughout history.<br><br>
							
							Today’s marketers are taking their campaigns to the internet to attract more clients, These advertisements have always been a source of inspiration. They are truly the future, with the current advancement of video on the web and the ease of exposure to it by the public.<br><br>
							
							I would like to work in the audiovisual production/distribution sector in the long term and participate in the production of projects and advertising spots just like "LAMP" IKEA.					</div>

							The film explore the theme of Berber permanence and resistance, using the story of Baya, a character who exemplifies the ability to resist while staying true to traditions, language, and thought. Azzedine Meddour addresses contemporary Algeria through Baya's intransigence, portraying it as an example for the entire people. The narrative, set almost a century ago, highlights Baya's determination and the peasants' collective effort to transform an arid mountain into a village, symbolizing resistance, courage, and perseverance.<br><br>

							Baya's struggle, as the daughter of a spiritual leader, becomes a fight for the survival of essential values, even at the cost of imposing sacrifices on her family. The film is described as a hymn to resistance, where ancestral references serve as a means of exorcising the forces of evil affecting humanity. Despite challenges during filming, including financial constraints and a tragic explosion, the director perseveres with the support of the team, merging reality and fiction.<br><br>
							
							This artwork film, much like the novel " la colline oubliée", stands out not only for its cinematic qualities but for its necessity.<br><br>
							
							"Adrar n baya" has a real personal value to me because my childhood was accompanied by my aunt’s stories about it's various behind-the-scenes and unfortunate incidents , in addition to the participation of one of our family members in this historical film. That old man with long white hair who I thought was Dumbledore from "Harry potter".
